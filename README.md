# opencv_drupal
Machine Learning (OpenCV) Drupal 8 sample integration

Based on https://github.com/php-opencv/php-opencv-examples and reworked into Drupal.

You will need opencv installed on your computer. You will need a taxonomy called *tags* and your file entities will need a field *field_tags* referencing it.
